![](resources/logo/cannoli_logo_212x118.png)

Cannoli is a Python-esque programming language designed to evaluate the
language features of Python that negatively impact performance.

### Cannolib
[Cannolib](https://github.com/joncatanio/cannolib) provides a number of types
and modules that offload work that would be otherwise done by the Cannoli
compiler. Cannolib provides the implementation of the overall type system as
well as built-in functions similar to those defined in the
[Python library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#built-in-functions)
